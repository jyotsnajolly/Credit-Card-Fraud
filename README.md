Context

Nielsen reports that U.S. card fraud (credit, debt, etc) was reportedly 9 billion dollars in 2016 and expected to increase to 12 billion dollars by 2020. For perspective, in 2017 both PayPal's and Mastercard's revenue was only $10.8 billion each. Therefore, it is important that credit card companies should be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Objective:

Suppose you are working as a Data scientist in a Credit Card company named "CCFraud" and given the credit card transactions, you need to build a Model (i.e. Multilayer perceptrons) for Fraud Detection using Keras.
